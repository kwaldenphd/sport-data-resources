# Case Study

## Prompt

Throughout the course, we will be engaging in virtual site visits, hosting guest speakers, and learning more about the current professional landscape of sport and data. As we broaden our collective understanding of this landscape, you also have the opportunity to do a deep dive into a sport data system, issue, context, or application that is of interest to you. These deep dives will take the form of case studies that will be shared or presented with the larger class. 

Each student will complete and/or contribute to at least one (1) case study. You can undertake this assignment individually or in a group. 

This assignment could take a variety of forms. Some examples:
- Research paper
- Research poster
- Blog post or visual essay
- Audio narrative
- Narrated presentation
- Video essay
- Infographic
- Timeline
- Interactive visualization

Length expectations:
- Written projects: at least 1200 words
- Audio/video media projects: at least 5 minutes
- Visual media projects: criteria developed in conversation with the instructor

These projects will be shared on the “Case Studies” Canvas discussion board, with the additional option of sharing or presenting the work in-class.

## Steps

Step #1: In-class time will be provided for brainstorming ideas and possible collaborations. Keep working on your own to browse the syllabus and consider possible topics of interest.

Step #2: When you/your group has a more developed idea, complete the case study Google Form (link posted in syllabus and on Canvas). This form needs to be completed by the end of Week #6.

Step #3: Instructor will follow up with feedback. We’ll talk over Zoom or via email about next steps.

Step #4: You’ll work on the project.

Step #5: You’ll submit and possibly present the project.

# Final Project

## Assignment Prompt

The final project for this course is an open-ended creation that engages topics, concepts, and other course elements. One of my goals for the final project is for you to have an opportunity to delve into and explore in greater depth an aspect of the course that interests you, while also having the opportunity to further develop skills you would like to hone.

You can undertake this project individually or in a group.

Projects that could fulfill this assignment might include:
- Analyze or audit an sport data technology system
- Draft a white paper or set of recommendations
- Build a public-facing interactive resource built using RStudio/Shiny or Python/Plotly (or another data science tool). 
- Research paper 
- Build a tutorial, package, module, or other type of technical documentation
- A podcast, video, or other type of multimedia/digital project that applies course concepts and interdisciplinary frameworks
- Some type of creative work (musical performance, dance, short story, piece of art, etc.) that connects to the work of this course

I will generally be open to final project ideas with a strong rationale and feasibility plan. Final projects do not have to include an applied data science component. But all projects, regardless of topic and method, are expected to incorporate critical interdisciplinary perspectives grounded in American Studies--that includes consideration of historical, cultural, and social context; identity; power; etc.

Things to consider when weighing final project options:
- Skills you bring to this course
- Who the project is “for,” or who you might want to be in conversation with
- What you might want or need to do with the project
- What resources you would still be able to access in the event of disruption

The wide range of project options makes it hard to have a single overarching criteria in terms of project length/scope. So we’ll approach this in terms of the number of hours you should expect to spend working on the final project.

Expect to spend at least 25 hours working on the final project. That includes brainstorming, meeting with instructor/colleagues, case study work (if applicable), in-class work time, etc. If you’re working on a project that is not going to take that much time, think about how to add complexity or take on another smaller scale project.

Contact the instructor with questions.

## Assignment Steps

We will move toward the final project in stages:
- [Brainstorming + proposal](#proposal)
- In-class work time
- [Optional project plan](#project-plan)
- [Project status update](#status-update)
- [In-class shareout](#shareout)
- All final project materials need to be submitted to the instructor by the date specified in the syllabus/on Canvas.

## Proposal

[Link to make a copy of the proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hXJVmHVxg6xjt10evAvk66_fJSHLV_WwGrJCGkYgGds/copy) (Google Doc)

Things to address in the proposal (or proposal conversation):
- Is this an individual or collaborative project?
  * If collaborative, who all is working on the project?
- Describe the topic or subject area you’re wanting to focus on in the final project.
- Who is this project for? Or who might be interested in the information you will be presenting?
- Go into more detail about what you plan to do in this project. What could you imagine as the deliverable?
- What kinds of research methods or information gathering work do you envision doing as part of this project?
- What questions or concerns do you have about the project you’re proposing? What resources, feedback, or support will you need to complete this project?

## Project Plan

NOTE: The project plan is optional (not required).
- [Link to make a copy of the plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhP295ao8ZonWy3dlgUAF0GDhC3Ifh8wODkoUnWcO2w/copy) (Google Doc)
- [Link to final project plan overview](https://notredame.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e6f43b09-914f-4914-a1c8-ad10003d5d4c) (Panopto)

## Status Update

*NOTE: The status update typically is due 10 days before the assignment deadline and prior to the last week of class (when presentations/shareouts take place).*

Status update constitutes some kind of substantive project update communicated with the instructor. Addresses what you’re working on, how things are going in relation to the project plan, problems/questions/challenges you’re facing.

This update can come in via email, Slack, Canvas, or an appointment or office hours conversation.

## Shareout

*NOTE: Shareouts take place over two days (2 class meetings) during the last full week of classes.*

Many ways to accomplish this share-out.
- Live presentation (minimum 5 minutes, not including questions; 10 minute max, not including questions)
- Pre-recorded video that’s screened during class time is also an option (same length range 5-10 minutes)
- Canvas post that includes discussion of project + process (at least 750 words)
